1. In Google Calendar, click on the three dots next to the calendar you want to share and choose "Settings and sharing".
2. Under the "Share with specific people" section, click "Add people".
3. Enter the email address of the person with whom you want to share the calendar.
4. In the "Permissions" drop-down list, select the appropriate level of access. To only show when you're busy, choose "See only free/busy (hide details)".
5. Click "Send". The person will receive an email with a link to add your calendar to their list.

Note: If you don't see the person's calendar after they've shared it, try refreshing your Google Calendar page or wait a few minutes.
